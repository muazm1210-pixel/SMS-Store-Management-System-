# 🛒 Shop Management System (Python Backend)

A simple, efficient, and console-based **Shop Management System Backend**
developed using **Python**.

This project is designed to manage day-to-day shop operations in a structured
and beginner-friendly way, entirely through the terminal.  
The system works completely offline and focuses on clean backend logic that can
later be extended into a web or API-based application.
