🛒 Shop Management System (Python Backend)

A simple, efficient, and console-based Shop Management System Backend developed using Python.
        This project is designed to manage day-to-day shop operations in a structured and beginner-friendly way, entirely through the terminal.
         The system works completely offline and focuses on clean backend logic that can later be extended into a web or API-based application.



🚀 Features:
•User Signup & Login system (Authentication)
•Secure access to shop operations                      
•Product Inventory Management
   •Add new products 
   •Update existing products 
   •View all products 
   •Delete products 
•Handles up to 2000 products efficiently 
•Billing System 
    •Calculates total bills 
    •Generates customer bills 
•Clean and modular backend structure 
•Fully offline console application 



🧠 What This System Does: 
This backend application allows shop owners or staff to: 
•Manage shop inventory without internet access 
•Perform secure user authentication 
•Handle sales transactions and generate bills 
•Maintain a clean and scalable backend codebase 

The logic is written in a way that makes future upgrades easy, such as connecting a database or building a REST API.



🔌 Offline & Future Online Support: 

✅ Works completely offline 
❌ No internet required 
🔄 Backend logic can later be converted into: 
    •Web Application 
    •REST API
    •Mobile App Backend 
    •Multi-user online system 



🛠 Technologies Used: 
•Python 3 
•File handling (for data storage) 
•Modular Python architecture 
•Console | Terminal based interface
